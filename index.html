                        My name is Alex Merkel and I'm very excited to be
                        here. I've spent the last few years figuring out what I
                        want to do and have FINALLY figured it out. I'm thrilled
                        to have found and be part of the Coding Temple community
                        and look forward to our time together.

                        I spent 3 years at my local university trying to figure
                        out what path I wanted to take. I started off in Computer
                        Engineering, switched over to Statistics, then finally
                        business with an emphasis in finance. Unfortunatley, I 
                        needed more time to determine what path I wanted. After 
                        a few years in the working world, I started to see what
                        I wanted to do. The trick now was, how do I get there?
                        Those responsibilities add up quick and I needed to find
                        the quickest/best path into coding. After a couple years
                        of planning (probably a bit of avoiding the big leap) I
                        made the decision that it was time.
                        It was clear that a bootcamp would be my best route. The
                        next challenge was, which one? That's when I found Coding
                        Temple. I saw the flexibility, the languages I wanted to,
                        and the reputation. I knew it was the right place and
                        FINALLY took the leap. I'm pursuing this full time and
                        so far love what we're learning. I can't wait to keep
                        learning more and build my future! I also want to say
                        THANK YOU! I have a renewed sense of purpose and know
                        I'm in good hands to get my dreams moving forward.

                        I've always liked technology. It's seemed to have liked
                        me too. Ever since I can remember, I would be the one in
                        our family in charge of fixing all things electronic. I
                        swear half the time, it would fix itself. Naturally, I
                        got into video games at quite a young age as well. I'm
                        not too picky, but open-world and RPG's are my jam.
                        I also really like traveling. That's a big part of what
                        my future is going to be. I really like out West and all
                        the gorgeous mountains. I'll admit the amount of remote
                        work in this field helped cement this is what I want to
                        do. I love the outdoors and can't wait to start camping
                        and traveling more often. I'm also a big football fan. I
                        like sports in general, but football has a special place
                        in my heart.

                        I've got a long time girlfriend, her name is Kristina.
                        My parents, brother, and sister live pretty close by. My 
                        little brother is about to graduate in May with a
                        computer science degree (another reason why I knew this
                        is the right path for me). Kristina and I also have a dog
                        named Bub and a cat named Roo. They're both pretty
                        adorable and filled with personality. I'll include some
                        pics of them to see for yourself. One day (hopefully
                        pretty soon), Kristina, Bub, Roo, and myself plan to move
                        out West. We're getting Roo's paws wet to see if she'll
                        be okay with being an adventure kitty, but still have a
                        ways to go. Bub is down for whatever, as long as his Mom
                        is nearby.
